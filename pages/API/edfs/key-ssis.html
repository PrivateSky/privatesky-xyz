    <psk-chapter title="Introduction">
        The two purposes of the KeySSI concept are, firstly,  to provide blockchain-anchored identities for things, processes but
        potentially for companies and individuals. The concept of KeySSI is more general than the concept proposed by
        the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C DID web standard</a>. Secondly, KeySSIs
        are used as secret (symmetrical) encryption/decryption keys for DSUs (or for parts of the DSUs).
        A KeySSI never comes alone, but is accompanied by KeySSIs derived from it or KeySSIs from which it was derived.
        Derivation can be understood as a form of delegation, someone who holds a KeySSI with a higher access level
        delegates access to lower levels. Based on this derivation, KeySSIs are used to implement an access control mechanism
        on DSUs.

    <psk-chapter title="Key SSI syntax">
        The syntax of KeySSIs is inspired by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C DID</a>, but the KeySSI starts with the “ssi” string and the DID
        methods are interpreted as subtypes and not as incompatible methods.

            <code>subtype</code> is a string representing the KeySSI's type.
            <code>Ledger.domain/path</code> represents a path in a blockchain hierarchy.
            <code>Subtype specific</code> is usually a Zero Access SSI (zaSSI).
            <code>Control</code> is used by the anchoring services to validate the requests for a new version of the anchored DSU. The algorithm used for verification is subtype specific.
            <code>vn</code> is a string reflecting the version number of the subtype. The <code>vn</code> field is optional and, if missing, is set to <code>v0</code>.  Each version establishes the hash function and algorithm used by the control mechanisms.
            <code>Hint</code>  is optional and subtype specific. Typically provides some additional information to the KeySSI resolver.

        <psk-chapter title="SecretSSIs subtypes family (Self certifying SSIs)">
            The most important subtypes of KeySSI are self certifying SSIs. The self certification properties are coming
            from the usage of the hash of a public key as part of the identifier. The image below shows shows the main
            types
            of self certifying KeySSIs and the access level each type provides.

            <psk-highlight type-of-highlight="note" title="Note">
                The downward arrow in the image above represents the <code>derivation</code> operation; the
                lower level KeySSIs are derived from higher level KeySSIs. A lower level KeySSI is, usually, obtained
                by applying a cryptographic hash function to a higher level KeySSI. The above KeySSI hierarchy is called
                the <code>SecretSSI family</code>.
            </psk-highlight>
            <psk-highlight type-of-highlight="example" title="Self certifying KeySSIs' generation">
                SecretSSI := random():hpk <br>
                AnchorSSI := hash(SeedSSI):hpk <br>
                ReadSSI := hash(AnchorSSI):hpk<br>
                PublicSSI := hash(ReadSSI):hpk<br>
                zaSSI := hash(PublicSSI):hpk
            </psk-highlight>
            In the example above:
            <psk-list type="unordered">
                <code>random</code> is a cryptographically safe random generating function
                <code>hash</code> is a cryptographic hashing function
                <code>hpk</code> is the hash of the public key
            </psk-list>
            As seen in the above example, the SecretSSI family is created starting from a random secret number (256bits) in
            the subtype specific part of the
            identifier and the hash of a public key in the control part. All the other subtypes are derived using a hash
            function from the subtype specific part of the previous subtype
            (<psk-link chapter="SecretSSIs subtypes family (Self certifying SSIs)">see the above image</psk-link>).
            The blockchain's state and the public key's hash are preserved during subtype derivation.

        <psk-chapter title="Seed based subtypes family">
            Seed based KeySSI's are not self-certifying (do not contain a reference to the public key in their identifiers).
            The image and table below show the Seed based KeySSI family and the purposes of each KeySSI:
