  <psk-chapter title="Abstract">
    <p align="justify">A CSB is a BAR containing a blockchain and optionally a folder with the code of a SSApp. Any CSB is associated to the code of a Blockchain Constitution. We mean by Constitution a collection of swarm definitions, assets and transactions. Any modification of the CSB embedded blockchain content must be operated only using the Constitution code.</p>
    <p align="justify">The Constitution is encapsulated in a BAR that is, at its turn, anchored to the CSB blockchain. The Constitution may allow or deny the constitution's update. Some CSB are not allowing modifications of the constitution.</p>
