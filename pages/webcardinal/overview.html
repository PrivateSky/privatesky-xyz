    <p>
        WebCardinal represents the complete rewrite version of
        <webc-link tag="cardinal-web-components-mvc">Cardinal</webc-link>, with the aim to enable an even more rapid
        development of WEB applications. WebCardinal offers almost all the functionalities of Cardinal, either is the
        same form or by providing an easier alternative.
    </p>

    <psk-description title="Cardinal compatibility">
        Since WebCardinal is a complete rewrite of Cardinal, there may be some cases in which backward compatibility is
        not offered.

        <psk-highlight type-of-highlight="issue">
            One such good example of limited compatibility is with Cardinal's
            <webc-link tag="psk-modal">psk-modal</webc-link>, which is not at all supported in the new version. Instead,
            the improved <webc-link tag="webc-modal">webc-modal</webc-link> was created.
            <br />
            Read more about it in its dedicated <webc-link tag="webc-modal">documentation</webc-link>.
        </psk-highlight>

        <psk-highlight type-of-highlight="note">
            The current webpage is a working example of a WEB application written using WebCardinal and including also
            Cardinal components.
        </psk-highlight>

        <p>Any known incompatibilities with Cardinal are explained when applicable.</p>

    <psk-description title="Configuration">
        WebCardinal offers the same configuration possibilities as Cardinal, while offering some extra ones.
        <br />
        Read more about it in the documentation for
        <webc-link tag="webcardinal-configuration">Configuration</webc-link>.

    <psk-description title="Components">
        WebCardinal offers some useful components to make the development of WEB applications even more easier.

    <psk-description title="Attributes">
        WebCardinal comes with some very useful and powerful attributes that can be used on mainly every HTML element.

        <!-- prettier-ignore -->
        <psk-list>
            <webc-link tag="data-for">data-for</webc-link> - improved and optimized version of the <webc-link tag="psk-for-each">psk-for-each</webc-link> component
            <webc-link tag="data-if">data-if</webc-link> - improved and optimized version of the <webc-link tag="psk-condition">psk-condition</webc-link> component
            <webc-link tag="data-model">data-model</webc-link> - used for binding many tag attributes to the same element
            <webc-link tag="data-tag">data-tag</webc-link> - used for an easier event subcription experience
        </psk-list>

        <psk-highlight type-of-highlight="issue">
            Considering the fact that Cardinal's psk-* components handle their own logic, flow and HTML manipulation,
            not all of them can integrate perfectly with the new attributes of WebCardinal. So extra care needs to be
            taken in this case.

    <psk-description title="Controllers">
        <p>WebCardinal's approach to controllers is similiar with the one from Cardinal.</p>

        <p>
            Currently, WebCardinal offers the following Controllers which can be extended based on the given
            requirements:
        </p>

        <!-- prettier-ignore -->
        <psk-list>
            <code>Controller</code>: offers the basic functionalities of the framework
            <code>WebController</code>: offers some basic interaction with the WebCardinal components
        </psk-list>

        <p>The controlers can be used from <code>WebCardinal.controllers</code> available on the window object.</p>

        <!-- prettier-ignore -->
        <psk-code language="JavaScript">
            const { WebcController } = WebCardinal.controllers;

            class Page1Controller extends WebcController {
                getModel = (_) => ({
                    field1: 1,
                    field2: 2
                });

                constructor(element, history) {
                    super(element, history);
            
                    this.setModel(this.getModel());

        </psk-highlight>

        <p>
            WebCardinal went further and added a more standardised and consistent approach to models and model binding.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of the HTML element and also custom elements have support for binding. One-way binding is ensured for
            every element, but there may be some limitations for two-way binding when using non-native HTML form
            elements. Read more about WebcCardinal's forms <webc-link tag="webcardinal-forms">here</webc-link>.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to offer a consistent approach for binding, WebCardinal has support for a special attribute
            <code>data-model</code>.
        </p>

        <psk-description title="{{ }} binding syntax">
            <p>
                WebCardinal has added a new syntax that allows model binding (and also translation binding) inside the
                template nodes.
